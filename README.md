# Location Explorer
## By: Repo Reapers

## Description

Accomodation by location! This site allows the user to explore any selected location worldwide. From worldwide travelers to homeotwn hangouts, this site has it all. The user can then see the weather for the location along with nearby accomodation from hotels and restaurants to car dealerships and public toilets. This is a useful tool for finding a new gym in your hometown, or eploring a city park across the world. The Repo Reapers are an inquisitive bunch that allow their curiosity to drive their exploration of many establishments. This site helps bring knowledge to subside that curiosity a user may experience as well. Throughout this project we learned through trials and tribulations of working with APIs, HTML, JavaScript, and a wonderful touch of CSS. Added learning experiences include working collaboratively through Github and VS Code, communicating blockages, and coordinating meeting times to ensure a smooth work flow.
